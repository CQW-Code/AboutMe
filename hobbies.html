            <p>I enjoy playing online point and click games as 
            well as online riddle trails.  I've played many over the 
            years including a large team based one called Invasion. Invasion was
            started in 2006 by a wife and husband team (no longer together).
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            Invasion involved several teams of players in a race to solve
            "rounds" given to us by the creators.  We were to solve anything 
            from Polybus Squares to deciphering photos and hidden clues. 
            Sometimes we'd get 'egg pages' to steer us in the right direction.
            The goal was reached when we solved the final page and a destination 
            was given. The beauty of this game was that we were to go out and get a 
            picture of the destination with our team sign.  This is where having many
            people from all over the world on our team becomes an advantage! We had 
            folks from the US, UK, Belgium, Romania, Spain, Canada and India to name a few!
            </p>
            
            <br> <br>
            
            Below are two examples of how the "destination" was done to win a round.

            Sadly Invasion and its sister site Clever Waste of Time is no longer up. The person 
            responsible decided to take the sites offline to update and no indication if it will
            ever return at this point.

            <br>This site contains MANY tools to aid the riddler. It's great for those
