         My first job was as a Communication Specialist working with deaf and nonverbal
         residents of a residential facility for intellectually disabled children and 
         adults.  It was here I got into computers more (along with my first computer as a 
         college graduation gift).  I later became a Case Manager taking on most of the deaf and 
         non-verbal clients in the building I worked in, then changed to a different set- those
         with dual diagnoses- mental illness AND intellectual disability- teenagers too!
      </p>
         <br>
        <p>
            I then left that job and attended The Chubb Institute in Pennsylvania- back then 
            that was considered a "boot camp"- 7 month program in learning COBOL, C++ and Visual Basic 4.
         </p>
         <br>
         <p>
             After that I became a Quality Assurance tester working on Mainframe COBOL applications and
             CICS screens.  I moved around to many states- Colorado, Georgia, Arizona and South Carolina and
             in many industries- health insurance, MCI World Com and even a short stint with FireVine testing web pages.
         </p>
             <br>
         <p>
            I'm also a graduate of DevPoint Labs based in Salt Lake City, UT.  I picked up many new skills
            including Ruby, Ruby on Rails, React, Git, Jest, RSpec and refreshers on HTML/CSS, javascript(more 
            like a "oh no...") and SQL (my favorite).  With these skills and my past experience with Mainframe/COBOL/CICS
            and QA Testing I hope to find a rewarding and challenging position.  
            <br>
            That sounded a bit trite didn't it?  Seriously though, I'm not one to shy away from
            learning new skills and whatever else I find interesting. Learning is  a life long pursuit and 
            a passion of mine.  It's with this desire that I want to get back into the "job market"!
