     <p>
         My first job was as a Communication Specialist working with deaf and nonverbal
         residents of a residential facility for intellectually disabled children and 
         adults.  It was here I got into computers more (along with my first computer as a 
         college graduation gift).  I later became a Case Manager taking on most of the deaf and 
         non-verbal clients in the building I worked in, then changed to a different set- those
         with dual diagnoses- mental illness AND intellectual disability- teenagers too!
      </p>

        <p>
            I then left that job and attended The Chubb Institute in Pennsylvania- back then 
            that was considered a "boot camp"- 7 month program in learning COBOL, C++ and Visual Basic 4 (I'm old!).
         </p>

         <p>
             After that I became a Quality Assurance tester working on Mainframe COBOL applications and
             CICS screens.  I moved around to many states- Colorado, Georgia, Arizona and South Carolina and
             in many industries- health insurance, MCI World Com and even a short stint with FireVine testing web pages.

              My goals for this course is to add to my skills and to move a bit further into the present 
              and future... and not fall flat on my face. :)
